    - Ahh-who are you, slimy creature? Have you come to make fun of us as well?
    - "\u2026 Oh\u2026I\u2019m sorry for calling you a slimy creature. I thought
      you were like the rest."
    - "The only reason why anyone comes to this part of the zoo is to ridicule us.
      I don\u2019t have a problem with it, but the others\u2026"
    - "Huh? You want to escape? That\u2019s a great idea! I would\u2019ve escaped
      already, but I don\u2019t want to leave the others."
    - "They\u2019re all really sad because the humans make fun of how they look.
      They also don\u2019t have many friends because they spend their time being
      upset over the insults the humans like to make."
    - "I don\u2019t think they can even find the motivation to escape\u2026can you
      go talk to them? I\u2019ve tried many times, but it doesn\u2019t really seem
      to work."
    - Maybe hearing another perspective will cheer them up.

    - "Come back when you\u2019ve talked to everyone."

    lines:
    - I see you got our precious green blobs from frog and snake, and even the prized
      grandma turtle's shell.
    - I can already see everyone looking a little bit happier!
    - "Look-the snake is talking to others, the frogs aren\u2019t crying, and the
      turtle is smiling."
    - Thank you so much for making everyone happier. Now we can bring everyone out
      of this zoo.
    - You should keep grandma's shell, it really means a lot for you to help us like
      this.
    - Oh! Here's a discolored shell from one of our friends. You should show it to
      the royal animals, and maybe it can convice them to help us escape.
