    - Ahh, who are you?
    - "\u2026 Oh, hello. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been skittish lately."
    - "\u2026 You\u2019ve been to other enclosures?"
    - "Wow\u2026I\u2019m small, but I\u2019ve never thought of braving the pipe system
      before."
    - "\u2026 Yes, I would imagine that other habitats aren\u2019t as smoky as this
      one is. Well, it\u2019s because of the humans."
    - They thought the bees were going to sting us all, so they installed some smoke
      machines under the floorboards to make smoke so the bees would be calm.
    - " \u2026 But all it\u2019s done is make the bees lethargic and the yellowjackets
      angry, so they sting us all the time. The machines can be easily taken out,
      but we\u2019re too small to carry them."
    - "Quickly\u2026we all might die to smoke inhalation, or yellowjacket venom,
      just like my uncle Holland\u2026"

    - Oh, you removed the smoke machines?
    - "Phew, what a relief\u2026thank you. Everyone will get along much better now."
    - "What? Escape? I\u2019m not sure\u2026well, everyone here is small enough,
      and helping you is the least we can do to pay you back."
    - Here is a smoke machine to bring to the royal animals. It might convince them
      to help us.
